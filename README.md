# Restart Notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/restartus/restart-notebooks/master)

This repository houses notebooks that use the `restart` Python package to do PPE forecasting.

## Installation

These notebooks are hosted on binder (see badge above), or you can host them locally. To host locally, clone this repo, and then build the conda environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/restartus/restart-notebooks.git
brew cask install miniconda
make install
conda activate restart
```

The notebooks should now run using your preferred method of viewing Jupyter Notebooks.
